# Booking App

This is a mobile application that manages bookings. Users can create, view, and delete their bookings through this application. Each villa has an one account, and under each account, there are multiple users, each having their name, phone number, and email id.

For the frontend, I am using Flutter. Flutter offers several benefits that caught my attention, the most prominent ones being cross-platform compatibility, large collection of widgets, and retention of UI and logic across differnt platforms. The mobile application is only compatible with Android devices (iOS applications cannot be developed using Windows OS). Other users will have to use the web hosted version of the application, which was possible because of the cross-platform abilities of Flutter.

I have used minimalism in the UI/UX design of this app. This is to ensure that the users will not face any difficulty or discomfort in using the application. Additionally, Flutter's highly customizable UI design allowed me to create customized widgets, like text boxes, buttons, etc. which matched my intended theme.

For the backend, I have used Google Firestore, a NoSQL document database. This is very effective for small to medium scale mobile applications, which is a perfect match for the application being developed.
